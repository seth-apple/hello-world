# hello-world

Hey peeps! 

Welcome to my first repo. 
My name is Seth Apple and I am a student at NC State University. I enjoy coding and playing video games in my free time. I am hoping to get my Bachelor's in Computer Science and eventually work in the software development industry.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and have a good day!
